# Retro Computer Personal Website

https://www.edwardh.io/

This was a project I built for fun over one of my uni breaks, built in TypeScript and THREE.js, it contains a number of nifty features such as:
- 3D retro computer that you can interact with
- very simple UNIX shell implementation
- files system implementation
- markdown interrupteur and renderer
- text layout engine
