# Hi there

My name is Ed Hinrichsen and I have recently completed a Bachelor of Science, majoring in Computing and Software Systems at the University of Melbourne. I have a passion for all things technology and design, from software engineering & machine learning to UI/UX & 3D graphics.

In addition to my love of technology and design, I am also interested in education, history, economics and politics.

Type "cd ~/projects" then "ls" to see details of some of projects I have developed over my ten plus years of coding experience.
